<h1>CRUNCH Wizard</h1>

The CRUNCH wizard is invoked through CrunchController. There are two ways that
CrunchController might be invoked to display wizard:
<ul>
  <li>A capability is clicked in the Capability Store</li>
  <li>A capability intercept is returned by the server during a request</li>
</ul>

The Capability Store imports `crunchController` and calls it when a capability
is clicked. The store makes a call similar to the following:
<code>
this.crunchController.createWizardSequence(capability).execute()
</code>

More information on CrunchController and capability intercepts can be found in
the
<a href="/#admin.flowdoc::foam-nanos-crunch-doc">
  CRUNCH Developer Documentation
</a>

<h2>Wizard Sequences</h2>

CrunchController methods for invoking the wizard return instances of Sequence.
A sequence contains a number of steps that can be reconfigured or removed before
executing the whole chain. More information about sequences can be found in the
documentation for
<a href="/#admin.flowdoc::foam-util-async-doc">foam.util.async</a>.
The following documentation is derived from the sequence, as sequences are
self-documenting.
