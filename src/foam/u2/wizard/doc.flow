<h2>Wizardlet Models</h2>

<h4>Wizardlet</h4>

A wizardlet is an independent portion of a wizard. It describes its data, views,
and how it's saved and loaded. Wizardlets can be visible, allowing a user to
fill in their data; or invisible, providing hidden functionality for saving or
acting on wizard events.

<h4>WizardletSection</h4>

Wizardlets are sectioned. By default, a wizardlet will contain WizardletSection
instances derived from 'of's section axioms. The abstraction of WizardletSection
allows adding custom views to a wizardlet independently from the data model.

The MinMaxCapabilityWizardlet is an example where a custom WizardletSection is
used to display a selection of choices.

<h2>Wizards</h2>

Wizards are created by combining StepWizardController with a compatible view.
An instance of StepWizardController should be the value of the view's data
property.

<h4>StepWizardController</h4>

StepWizardController implements the behaviour for a wizard. It creates listeners
on all wizardlets to provide status properties like 'allValid' and
'visitedWizardlets'. It also contains logic for skippiing unavailable wizardlets
and moving the position backwards if a previous wizardlet becomes available.

The following properties are useful to initialize when creating the controller:

<h4>IncrementalStepWizardView</h4>

This is a view for StepWizardController implementing a "page by page" approach
wizard navigation. Each section will be seen on a separate screen, and the user
must click "next" to reach the next screen. Requiring the user to click next
allows control over how they proceed, as they must provide valid data before
continuing.

<h4>ScrollingStepWizardView</h4>

This is a view for StepWizardController implementing a single scrolling view
containing all sections. This allows a user to fill in sections in any order
they choose, making it ideal for cases where a user might not have all the
requirement information immediately.

<h4>StepWizardConfig</h4>

This is the model used for the 'config' property of StepWizardController.
